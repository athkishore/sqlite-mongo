# Introduction

SQLite-Mongo is envisaged as a mongod-compatible server application, which you can connect to using any of your favourite MongoDB clients or language drivers. The plan is to use SQLite as the storage backend.

The idea for this project is the result of my frustration at mongod being restricted to a narrow range of environments. For a while, I was hopeful that FerretDB would fill the gap, but with v2 they have completely dropped the SQLite backend to focus on Postgres.

The goals of SQLite-Mongo are ambitious and modest at once. It will never aim to be a full-fledged distributed database - no replication or sharding. However, it aims to implement as completely as possible the rich MongoDB commands (including sessions). So completely as to be able to effectively substitute mongod with sqlite-mongo for single-node operations.

# Roadmap

The first version will be written in Typescript (the only language I'm fluent in currently). The aim is to implement enough database commands to support basic CRUD functionality. Each document will be stored in a single JSON field in an SQLite table.

If this turns out to be successful, I have a more ambitious plan of reimplementing the server in C or another similar language to make it more performant. I also see some scope in writing SQLite extensions that can possibly store and operate on BSON natively. 

A more detailed roadmap will be made available as the project evolves.

# License

In the spirit of SQLite, the code for this project too will be in the public domain.

# Fun Project, Serious Project

This is first and foremost a project for me to have fun learning new things I would otherwise not have explored. At the same time, I see that it can fill a gap that is currently not served by any existing solution out there, if it turns out half as well as I hope it will.

There are intresting projects such as [LiteDB](https://www.litedb.org/), [Doclite](https://github.com/dwgebler/doclite), etc. but a lightweight mongod substitute that can talk to MongoDB clients is something different and will be so awesome to have.

Putting it out there even at this early stage in the spirit of building in public. I plan to document my journey on my [blog](https://akishore.in/blog). The journey matters as much as the outcome.
